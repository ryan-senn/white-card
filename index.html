        <h1>White Card QLD</h1>
        <p>
            If you wish to work in the construction industry, you will undoubtly be required to enter construction
            sites.
            With the many hazards associated with the busyness of construction sites, you must first undertake safety
            training, often referred to as safety induction training.
        </p>
        <p>
            The requirements are split in two: The theoretical knowledge and the licensing. Let's have a look at them.
        </p>
        <h2>The theory: CPCCWHS1001 - prepare to work safely in the construction industry</h2>
        <p>
            The theoretical aspect of the White Card course is the <a
                href="https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/CPCCWHS1001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unit of competency
                CPCCWHS1001</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unit of competency has been researched, designed and developed by <a href="https://www.artibus.com.au/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artibus</a>.
            The vocational education and training (VET) sector is overseen by the Australian Industry and Skills
            Committee (ASIC),
            who are advised by Industry Reference Committees (IRCs) on the needs certain sectors have for training.
            The Australian Government funds Skills Service Organisations (SSOs) to provide research and strategic
            direction to IRCS. SSOs are independent organisations.
            Artibus serves as the SSO for the IRCs in charge of the construction, plumbing and property services.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a nationally recognised unit of competency, it is delivered by registered training organisations (RTOs)
            under the supervision
            of the <a href="https://www.asqa.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Skills Quality Authority</a>, the
            Government body in charge of regulating the VET sector.
        </p>
        <h2>Finding a White Card training provider</h2>
        <p>
            You can find the best training providers using this comparison tool, which displays price, ratings, parking situation etc.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://whitecardbrisbane.com.au/white-card-brisbane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Card Brisbane providers</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://whitecardbrisbane.com.au/white-card-gold-coast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Card Gold Coast providers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Training package</h2>
        <p>Here is a quick overview taken from the package for the unit of competency:</p>
        <blockquote>
            This unit of competency specifies the mandatory work health and safety training required prior to
            undertaking construction work. The unit requires the person to demonstrate personal awareness and knowledge
            of health and safety legislative requirements in order to work safely and prevent injury or harm to self and
            others. It covers identifying and orally reporting common construction hazards, understanding basic risk
            control measures, and identifying procedures for responding to potential incidents and emergencies. It also
            covers correctly selecting and fitting common personal protective equipment (PPE) used for construction
            work.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The unit of competency is broken into 4 elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify health and safety legislative requirements of construction work</li>
            <li>Identify construction hazards and risk control measures</li>
            <li>Identify health and safety communication and reporting processes</li>
            <li>Identify incident and emergency response procedures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The unit is rated AQF level 1. You can <a href="https://www.aqf.edu.au/aqf-levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read about the AQF levels on this government page.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The licensing: White Card</h2>
        <p>
            The licensing of the White Card is done on a State level. Each state has its own occupational health and safety agency, known as WorkSafe (called SafeWork in some States). 
            They typically also look after WorkCover etc. They are in charge to ensure that safe work conditions are met, and as such are the licensing body for the White Cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted that although the cards are issued by State agencies, they are a nationally recognised license that will allow you to work in any State or Territories.
            What this means is that a White Card obtained in Queensland will be recognised and valid in NSW, VIC etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Blue Cards</h3>
        <p>
            The White Card used to be called the Blue Card. While they were fulfilling a similar mandate, the course an requirements have changed substantially since and as such, RTOs can't replace Blue Cards.
            If you have lost your Blue Card, you will need to complete the White Card course in order to be allowed on construction sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the White Card can be replaced by RTOs if you can prove that you have obtained the unit of competency CPCCWHS1001. They will typically ask to see a Statement of Attainment.
        </p>
        <h2>The cost of White Card courses</h2>
        <p>
            As the course is delivered by RTOs, they are free to charge what they seem appropriate. The competition is fairly high, helping to keep the prices down.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to myskills.gov.au, a registry of RTOs and training, the average price for the White Card course is $120. Some charge more, some charge less.
            If you are looking for an affordable course in Queensland, Tradie Training offers the course at just $79, making it much cheaper than almost all other organisations.
            You can find their <a href="https://www.myskills.gov.au/RegisteredTrainers/Details?rtocode=45555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training campuses on the myskills.gov.au website</a>.
